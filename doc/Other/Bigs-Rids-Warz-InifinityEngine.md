Why bigs rids / Warz / Titov / League of legend

All these games use the same engine as League of Legends, the eternity engine.
It was created by "titov", who sold the engine to Riot.

(you can find on beta of league an 3d modal for an grenade.sco / RPG.sco and other)

On some versions of "Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing" you can find the League of Legend EULA 
and you can technically copy paste a map of Big Rigs on League of Legend and it just works. 

WarZ is another Game (by "titov") that also uses the Eternity engine but it was improved.
The engine for WarZ was leaked (server , 3dmodal editor , netcode , map creator , eternity engine etc ...)
You can open sco on them and get the visual for example, and more.
